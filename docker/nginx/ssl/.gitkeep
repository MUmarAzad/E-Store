# Placeholder for SSL certificates
# In production, use Let's Encrypt or your own certificates

# To generate self-signed certificates for development:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem \
#   -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"

# For production with Let's Encrypt:
# 1. Install certbot
# 2. Run: certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot -d yourdomain.com
# 3. Certificates will be saved to /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/

# Files expected in this directory:
# - fullchain.pem (certificate chain)
# - privkey.pem (private key)
